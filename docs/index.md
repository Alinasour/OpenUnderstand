## Introduction
Understand [1] has an extensive API to let developers query the data it captures about their code. It has three flavors: Perl, Python, and C. We work with Python API.  All three implementations of the Understand APIs are read-only. They do not modify the Understand project information. If there is a need to modify Understand project information programmatically, the 'und' tool must be used. Unfortunately, the Understand API source code is not publicly available, making it difficult to change and reuse in a different environment. 

This project aims to provide an open-source implementation of the Understand Python API to analyze the source codes. We primarily focus on implementing the API for Java programs using Python programming languages and compiler tools such as ANTLR [2]. To develop an open-source implementation of Understand Python API, we look at the structures used by Understand for analyzing source codes.
