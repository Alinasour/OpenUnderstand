# Core entity-reference development

The following proposal has been initially prepared for the **IUST Compiler** and **IUST Advanced Compiler**  courses in Fall 2021.

**Note:** Before reading this proposal ensure that you have read and understood the [OpenUnderstand white-paper](../index.md).

Students must form groups of up to *three* persons. Each group must develop analysis passed for finding a subset of references kinds listed in [Table 2](../reference_kinds.md) along with their corresponding entities. The exact list of reference kind will be assigned to each group subsequently. The entity kinds in [Table 1](../entity_kinds.md) and references kinds in [Table 2](../reference_kinds.md) _may_ update during the semester for bug fixing purposes.
